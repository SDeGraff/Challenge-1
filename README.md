# Challenge-1

This is my attempt at refactoring the HTML & CSS to make this website more accessable to others with impairments. 

I have changed tags so they will provide more detail to the content.

I corrected a broken link. when "search engine optomization" was clicked in the navbar it wouldn't take you to the section in reference. I added the Id to the tag and now it will bring you to the section when clicked. 

I also made sure that the <h1>-<h3> tags were in sequential order. 

here is a screenshot of the website after I made these corrections.
